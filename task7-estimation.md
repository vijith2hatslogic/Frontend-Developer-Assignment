## Estimation Tasks

### Task 1: Break Down the Project
**Time: 10 minutes**

Create a detailed breakdown of the project into manageable tasks. For each task, provide:

1. **Task Description**: Clear, specific description
2. **Dependencies**: What other tasks must be completed first
3. **Complexity Level**: Low/Medium/High
4. **Time Estimate**: Hours or days
5. **Resources Needed**: Tools, libraries, team members
6. **Risk Factors**: Potential challenges or blockers

### Task 2: Technology Stack Justification
**Time: 5 minutes**

Justify your technology choices for:

1. **State Management**: Why Redux Toolkit vs Zustand vs Context API?
2. **Styling Solution**: Why SCSS vs Styled Components vs Tailwind?
3. **Charting Library**: Why Chart.js vs D3.js vs Recharts?
4. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests vs Integration tests vs E2E tests?
5. **Build Tool**: Why Vite vs Webpack vs Parcel?

### Task 3: Implementation Phases
**Time: 10 minutes**

Divide the project into phases and provide:

1. **Phase 1**: Core functionality (MVP)
2. **Phase 2**: Advanced features
3. **Phase 3**: Polish and optimization
4. **Phase 4**: Testing and deployment

For each phase:
- **Duration**: Total time estimate
- **Deliverables**: What will be completed
- **Dependencies**: What must be ready
- **Success Criteria**: How to measure completion

### Task 4: Risk Assessment
**Time: 5 minutes**

Identify and assess:

1. **Technical Risks**: Complex integrations, performance issues
2. **Timeline Risks**: Scope creep, dependency delays
3. **Resource Risks**: Team availability, skill gaps
4. **Mitigation Strategies**: How to address each risk

### Task 5: Quality Assurance Plan
**Time: 5 minutes**

Define your approach for:

1. **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, code reviews
2. **Testing Strategy**: What to test and how
3. **Performance**: Monitoring and optimization
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Supported browsers and devices

## Sample Estimation Template

```
Task: User Authentication System
Description: Implement JWT-based authentication with login, logout, and token refresh
Dependencies: API endpoints, user database
Complexity: Medium
Time Estimate: 16 hours
Resources: Frontend developer, backend API
Risk Factors: Token security, session management
```

## Questions to Answer

1. **What would you estimate as the total project duration?**
2. **Which tasks would you prioritize for the MVP?**
3. **How would you handle scope changes during development?**
4. **What would you do if you're running behind schedule?**
5. **How would you ensure code quality and maintainability?**

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Accuracy**: Realistic time estimates
- **Detail**: Comprehensive task breakdown
- **Logic**: Sound reasoning for technology choices
- **Risk Awareness**: Identification of potential issues
- **Communication**: Clear explanation of approach
- **Experience**: Evidence of real-world project knowledge

## Time Limit: 35 minutes

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Detailed task breakdown** with time estimates
2. **Technology stack justification** with reasoning
3. **Implementation phases** with dependencies
4. **Risk assessment** with mitigation strategies
5. **Quality assurance plan** with testing approach
6. **Answers to all questions** with explanations
